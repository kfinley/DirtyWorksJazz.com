      The group hosts jazz jams and plays gigs around San Francisco. A Dirty Works & Friends jam
      transforms a venue into a buzzing jazz laboratory. Far from casual background music, these
      jams are professional performance environment where the house band sets a high bar and invites
      local players to sit in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The repertoire is heavily inspired by the “Golden Era” of jazz (1945–1965), especially the
      catalogs of Riverside, Impulse, and Blue Note records. Expect a hard-driving mix of bebop,
      hard bop, heavy swing, and Latin jazz.

      Unlike “casual jam circles,” a Dirty Works Jazz Jam is first and foremost a show for the
      audience. The band prioritizes a polished, professional sound, ensuring that even the most
      experimental improvisations remain engaging for the listeners in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dirty Works Jazz Band also hosts the only monthly Burlesque & Jazz Jam in San Francisco
      each 1st Thursday at Paris 75 in the historic North Beach neighborhood.
