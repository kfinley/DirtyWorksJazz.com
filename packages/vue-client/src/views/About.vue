      A Dirty Works Jam transforms a venue into a buzzing jazz laboratory. Far from casual
      background music, these jams are professional performances where the house band sets a high
      bar and invites local players to sit in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group's repertoire is heavily inspired by the “Golden Era” of jazz (1945–1965), especially
      the catalogs of Riverside, Impulse, and Blue Note records. Expect a hard-driving mix of bebop,
      hard bop, heavy swing, and Latin jazz.

      Unlike “casual jam circles,” a Dirty Works Jazz Jam is first and foremost a show for the
      audience. The band prioritizes a polished, professional sound, ensuring that every song is an
      engaging experience for the audience. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dirty Works Jazz also hosts the only Burlesque & Jazz Jam in San Francisco every 1st Thursday
      at Paris 75 in the historic North Beach neighborhood. The show features our favorite
      burlesque dancer Raya!
